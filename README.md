# SpaceX-Falcon-9-First-Stage-Landing-Prediction
SpaceX is an American aerospace manufacturer, space transportation services and communications corporation. It was founded in 2002 by Elon Musk, with the goal of reducing space transportation costs to eventually enable the colonization of Mars. It has stood out among the leading aerospace companies with its string of remarkable accomplishments, which include sending spacecraft to the International Space Station, creating a satellite internet constellation providing satellite internet access, as well as sending manned missions to space. A primary reason behind the stellar success of SpaceX is its relatively inexpensive rocket launches. To compare, the advertised launching cost of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket is 62 million dollars, while the same for other providers is over 165 million dollars. This stark contrast is mainly due to the fact that SpaceX can reuse the first stage of a rocket. Thus, to estimate the cost of a launch, it is critical to predict whether the first stage will land or not. In this project, we attempt to predict first stage landing of the Falcon 9 rocket.
